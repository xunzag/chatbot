It creates a system for the regulation of traffic  (including pedestrian and bicycle traffic) and warning, informing and guiding road users. It also plays a  significant role in promoting safe speeds through physical measures (e.g. raised pavements, including speed  humps), speed limit signage and advisory speed signs.  All TTM has a critical role in relation to road user behaviour and the safety of road users. To this end, it is  essential that the design and use of TTM takes into consideration road user factors to ensure that road users"

In particular, it needs to be recognised that problems with public awareness or understanding of the  TTM at a worksite can occur because:  \u2022 road users do not understand the devices, particularly newer devices  \u2022 drivers do not appreciate the dangers to workers and other road users if traffic control devices are not  given adequate respect, attention and appropriate response"

Authorisation from the relevant road infrastructure manager needs to be  obtained prior to works commencing, normally during the planning stage (TMP phase). Details of the  temporary speed limit, approximate length of the temporary speed zone (e.g. temporary speed limit of 60  km/h for 150 m) and associated roadwork signing is submitted with the TMP. If alternative means of traffic  control are adequate, there is no need to implement additional temporary speed zones."

Excavations require special consideration to ensure their structural integrity and minimise the risk of road  users losing control and driving into them, and the safety of road workers. Consider also any above ground  hazards near the excavation (e.g. signs, other devices, excavated material).

This design is typically prepared in  the form of a traffic guidance scheme (TGS) which is subsequently applied by field staff when installing these  schemes at road worksites.   This Part of AGTTM deals specifically with those worksites which involve vehicles moving progressively  along the roadway at speeds significantly lower than other traffic. All signs and devices are either vehicle  mounted or moved along the roadway as works progress.   AGTTM Part 4, together with Part 3: Static Worksites and Part 5: Short Term Low Impact Works of AGTTM,  provides comprehensive guidance for the design of TGS at all worksites.  Aspects covered in AGTTM Part 4 for the design of TTM include:  \u2022"

For example, the afternoon school peak period often creates a  spike in traffic volumes and can be an undesirable time undertake mobile works due to the loss of road  capacity creating excessive disruption such as queuing.

Detailed  guidance on TMP processes are outlined in AGTTM Part 2. It is important that the TMP is completed before  further considerations and design of TTM outlined in this Part of the Guide are implemented. This design  involves the preparation of a Traffic Guidance Scheme (TGS), in some cases more than one, detailing traffic  control signs, devices and measures to be applied at worksites to warn road users and guide them past a  work area or temporary hazard. The work area is defined as an area where workers (including workers on  foot) may be located."

It provides guidance for the planning, design  and implementation of safe, economical and efficient temporary traffic  management designs. This Guide recognises the level of variability of the  road environments for which guidance is provided. The guidance provided  in AGTTM is intended to encourage a consistent level of planning that  supports the streamlined safe progress of work. It applies to all works on  roads and near roads, in addition to off road development and other  activities that interact with and impact on the road environment."

It has been  a primary process for a wide range of safety related functions for many years, particularly in the area of work  health and safety.  Within the context of risk management, the distinction between a hazard and a risk must be understood.   Hazard is any aspect that can cause harm or damage to humans, property, or the environment. In the  context of TTM, a hazard is focussed on any item or event that affects the safety of road workers or  road users.   Risk  is the probability that exposure to a hazard will lead to a negative consequence. Importantly a  hazard poses no risk if there is no exposure to that hazard. Risks can include a range of other"

There are three core components to the risk management process as defined by the Standard. These are:  \u2022 establishing the context   \u2022 risk assessment, which is comprised of identifying, analysing and evaluating risk  \u2022 treating the risk.  Operating across these three components, and interacting with them at multiple levels, is the additional risk  management components of communication/consultation and monitoring/review."

The adopted plan must be checked to ensure that it is suited to the road  environment where it is to be applied and accounts for the traffic conditions that are reasonably expected to  occur throughout the operation of the plan. Road safety audits and the process described in Austroads  Guide to Road Safety Part 6 (2019a) and Part 6A (2019b) are a good means of fulfilling this broader  requirement to provide a safe road environment, even for TTM measures.  Two levels of road safety audit are applicable to TTM guidance schemes at road work sites. These are:  \u2022 road safety audits of roadwork traffic schemes  \u2022 road safety audits for roads open to traffic."

This extends to its employees, its contractors and members of the public.  To ensure the safety of people at work sites, a high standard of temporary traffic management and traffic  control around, past or through those work sites must be provided. A site-specific plan for the management  of traffic can be developed by considering the conditions that may be encountered at each site.

The IAU is a mobile crash cushion safety device, used as  an advance warning device on approach to work sites to provide for increased road user safety if struck.   The primary purpose of an IAU is to reduce the impact for errant road users and should not be used as the  sole protection method for work sites from unexpected vehicle impacts."

Vehicles should be able to be detected as indicated by the visual monitor at a distance of 5 m to 30 m  ahead of the signal stand.

Since recovery is less likely on the unshielded, traversable 3:1 slopes, fixed objects should not be present in  the vicinity of the toe of these slopes. Recovery of high-speed vehicles that encroach beyond the edge of the  shoulder may be expected to occur beyond the toe of the slope. Determination of the recovery area at the toe  of the slope should take into consideration available road reservation, environmental concerns, economic  factors, safety needs, and crash histories. Also, the distance between the edge of the travelled lane and the  beginning of the 3:1 slope should influence the recovery area provided at the toe of the slope. While the"
